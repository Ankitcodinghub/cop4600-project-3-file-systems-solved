Your cover in the Lizard Legion was blown, and you’ve been revealed as a double agent and driven out! It was all very “James Bond”, if you do say so yourself, and what a daring underground helicopter escape it was… but you feel lucky to have escaped with your skin. (Literally… they would have used you to make a “human suit”!) Now that you’re back on the “outside”, you’ve been tasked with creating a scheme to allow remaining resistance fighters still within the Lizard Legion to clandestinely move information back to your organization without raising suspicion. As of late, members of the Lizard Legion have discovered the PC classic “DOOM”, and it has become all the rage to build new mods for it at headquarters, so your team has decided to use mods for this title as a vehicle for exfiltration. By burying encrypted bits within textures and other game data blocks, information can be hidden within innocuous “WAD” (Where’s All the Data) files.
